#Ski Holiday Archive and Costs in PHP
This is a version of the ski trip costing and archive using PHP/MySql and BootStrap.
+ List Previous Trips
+ Add a Trip and calculate totals (maybe even add photo)
+ Graph costs of a trip
+ Graph costs of previous Trips


It should be an exercise in using PHP and Mysql and a framework(bootstrap)
It should be examples of using programming stuff like
+ reading and writing to a databases
+ looping - while, for etc.
+ conditional statements - If and Case
+ using boolean operators
+ calling functions and returning values
+ passing parameters 
+ using session variable
+ reading in sensitive data(db login details) via hidden(non navigablely stored) config files
+ getting user input and validating this both via PHP and JavaScript
+ formatting output in HTML and CSS
+ basic native login to protect sesitive functionality - add, and update and delet

Maybe
+ use ajax and json for search etc.
+ add photo (this could become like a holiday website..)
+ use facebook/google/twttier login apis (needs to be deployed online to get this)
